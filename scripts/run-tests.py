`dotnet test`, but a test module that never ran is reported as INCONCLUSIVE.

When a test module cannot start at all - Windows Smart App Control blocking
a freshly built test host (0x800711C7), a missing or non-executable apphost -
`dotnet test` (Microsoft Testing Platform) still prints
"Test run summary: Passed!" and "failed: 0", counting only the modules that
did run. Its exit code is non-zero, but the summary a human reads says the
opposite. A module that ran zero tests reads the same way.

This passes every argument straight through to `dotnet test`, prints its
output as it arrives, and then - if any module never started or ran no
tests - ends with an unmistakable verdict naming them:

    Test run summary: INCONCLUSIVE - 1 test module(s) did not run: ...

and exits with INCONCLUSIVE_EXIT_CODE, never 0. Otherwise it exits with
`dotnet test`'s own code.

Usage: run-tests.py [any dotnet test arguments]
    run-tests.py --solution Xfty.ci-cross-platform.slnf --filter "Category!=Performance"

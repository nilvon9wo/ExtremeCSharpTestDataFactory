ReSharper inspections as a CI gate: what Roslyn misses.

`dotnet build` never fails on IDE0005 (unnecessary using), even with
EnforceCodeStyleInBuild; ReSharper's free command-line `inspectcode` reports
it (RedundantUsingDirective), along with redundant casts, qualifiers and
nullable suppressions, unresolvable doc-comment references, and more. Every
finding fails this gate - inspections that contradict this repo's documented
standards are switched off, with reasons, in `.editorconfig`, never left to
pile up as noise.

Three details matter, each of which once produced a silent pass or a bogus
failure:

* `--no-build`: without it inspectcode builds first and, if the build fails,
  writes NO report at all - which reads exactly like "no findings". The build
  gate owns compilation; this gate only inspects. A missing report is treated
  as a failure here, never as a pass.
* `--caches-home` pointing at a fresh, throwaway directory: inspectcode's
  default cache can keep serving `.editorconfig` settings from before an
  edit, reporting findings the current settings no longer produce (or
  missing ones they now do).
* `--severity=SUGGESTION`: the default (WARNING) hides most of the useful
  inspections, RedundantUsingDirective included.

Usage:
    inspect-code.py                          # the whole solution
    inspect-code.py <project-or-solution>    # e.g. the canary project

Prints `path:line: RuleId: message` per finding; exits 1 on any finding, or
if inspectcode wrote no report.
